```
git clone git@github.com:188king/http_bench.git
cd http_bench
go build http_bench.go
```

## Basic Usage

```
./http_bench -n 1000 -c 10 -t 3000 -m GET http://www.baidu.com/

This runs a benchmark for 1000 requests, keeping 10 HTTP connections open, and timeout is 3000ms

Output:
    Request:
    [1000] http://www.baidu.com
    Summary:
    Total:        5.2124 secs

    Fastest:      0.0195 secs
    Average:      0.0345 secs
    Requests/sec: 191.8491

    Status code distribution:
    [200] 1000 responses

    Latency distribution:
    10% in 0.0253 secs
    25% in 0.0272 secs
    50% in 0.0298 secs
    75% in 0.0350 secs
    90% in 0.0498 secs
    95% in 0.0606 secs
    99% in 0.0872 secs

    -cpus                 Number of used cpu cores.
                            (default for current machine is 4 cores)
    -host                 HTTP Host header.
    -file  Request url file, a launch request in the random selection file
```

You can try : ./http_bench -n 1000 -c 10 -t 3000 -m GET -file urls.txt
